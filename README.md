## Why this project exists

[Bambu Studio](https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio) is an excellent
open-source slicer, but every piece of code that actually talks to a
Bambu Lab printer — LAN discovery, MQTT telemetry, file transfer,
camera, OTA, cloud — lives in a closed-source shared library
(`libbambu_networking.so`, shipped as a "Network Plugin" Studio
downloads on first start). There's nothing inherently wrong with a
cloud product; the problem is the implementation:

- **The stock plugin ships an unaligned atomic that triggers the
kernel's `split_lock` detector on every modern Intel CPU.** Startup
stalls for 25-60 seconds while the kernel walks each trap; every
Device-tab click hits it again. The workaround
(`sysctl kernel.split_lock_mitigate=0`) degrades system-wide
performance and still misbehaves in LAN-only mode. Reported to Bambu
over a year ago and still open:
[bambulab/BambuStudio#8605](https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio/issues/8605).
- **No ARM or non-x86_64 build.** The plugin is only published as
Linux x86_64 (plus Windows and macOS). You can't use Studio or any
third-party tool that reuses the plugin on a Raspberry Pi, an
Ampere workstation, or any other aarch64 / riscv host, even though
the rest of Studio builds cleanly.
- **Cloud chatter on every action, even in LAN-only mode.** Even when
the printer is sitting on the same subnet as Studio in Developer
Mode, the stock plugin keeps reaching out to
`api.bambulab.com` / MakerWorld for things like bind status and
task metadata. That's extra latency on every click, a hard
dependency on the account infrastructure being up, and a
surveillance footprint a lot of users didn't opt in to.

This project is a drop-in replacement for that library: same `dlsym`
ABI, same file name, same install location, but open source,
aligned-atomic-clean, cross-architecture-buildable, and strictly
LAN-first (the cloud is only ever contacted for sign-in, so that
Studio's preset sync works — the rest is straight to the printer).

Protocol knowledge comes from
[OpenBambuAPI](https://github.com/Doridian/OpenBambuAPI) and the
reference implementations in
[bambulabs_api](https://github.com/acse-ci223/bambulabs_api) and
[ha_bambu_lab](https://github.com/greghesp/ha-bambulab); everything
else is reverse-engineered from MITM captures of the stock plugin.

For the technical reference — how Studio loads, validates and calls
the plugin, and the full list of ABI symbols and their semantics —
see [NETWORK_PLUGIN.md](NETWORK_PLUGIN.md). For a per-function
implementation status of this plugin against that ABI, see
[STATUS.md](STATUS.md).

Please note:

**This project has been built entirely through the author's enthusiasm, with a tremendous personal investment of time, effort, and financial resources. If this work helps you, please consider supporting its further development in the [Support the Developer and the Project](#support-the-developer-and-the-project) section.**

## Supported platforms

- Linux x86_64 (primary target, gcc 13+/15+, libstdc++new C++11 ABI).
- Linux aarch64 (primary target, cross-compile-friendly, see `cmake/toolchains/`).

Windows and macOS are architected for but not yet built and tested: the ABI uses
`std::string`/`std::map`/`std::function` across the boundary, which means we
would need to match MSVC's STL on Windows and Xcode/libc++ on macOS. Studio
also enforces a matching code-signing publisher on those OSes unless the user
sets `ignore_module_cert = 1`.

## Supported Bambu Studio versions

- **Minimum supported**: Bambu Studio **02.05.00.xx**
- **Maximum supported**: Bambu Studio **02.06.01.xx**

## Developer Mode requirement

Recent (2024+) printer firmware cryptographically verifies every MQTT command
it receives when the printer is paired with the Bambu cloud. The verification
uses a per-installation RSA key that the stock plugin ships as obfuscated data
and which we do not reproduce. Symptom on the printer screen when an unsigned
command arrives:

```
MQTT Command verification failed
err_code: 84033543
```

To use this plugin, put the printer in **Developer Mode**:

1. On the printer: Gear icon -> Settings -> LAN Only Mode -> enable "LAN Only", "LAN Only liveview" and "Developer mode".
2. In Bambu Studio: Device -> Connect via LAN with access code.

In this mode the printer skips MQTT verification and accepts plain LAN
commands. All LAN features of the plugin (discovery, telemetry, printing,
filename browsing, file transfer, camera) work normally.

Non-developer / hybrid / cloud-only modes are **only partially
implemented** and remain **severely limited**: the plugin can still
sign you into the cloud, fetch presets, and show telemetry, but **you
cannot reliably start a print** — the printer expects MQTT commands to
carry the stock plugin's RSA signature, which we do not ship. Without
Developer Mode every `print` / `project_file` / similar command is
rejected (`err_code: 84033543`). Fully replicating that signing chain
is out of scope for an open-source project. MakerWorld task history is
likewise out of scope.

## What works

The author only owns a **P2S**, so the "Tested" column in the table
below means "exercised with a real printer"; everything else is
reviewed against the stock plugin's disassembly, the
[OpenBambuAPI](https://github.com/Doridian/OpenBambuAPI) protocol
notes, and the
[ha_bambu_lab](https://github.com/greghesp/ha-bambulab) reference
implementation. Most features are protocol-level (same SSDP / LAN MQTT
/ FTPS on every Bambu printer) so hardware differences only matter for
a handful of rows — see "Applies to" for each row and the hardware
matrix further down.

**Community help is essential.** If you use another printer model or
CPU architecture, please try the plugin and open an issue on
[github.com/ClusterM/open-bambu-networking](https://github.com/ClusterM/open-bambu-networking)
with what works, what fails, and your firmware / OS / Studio version —
that is how we turn "not tested" into documented reality. Bug reports,
regressions, and small compatibility notes all belong in
**[Issues](https://github.com/ClusterM/open-bambu-networking/issues)**.

The tables below are a feature-level view. For an ABI-level view —
every single function Studio resolves from the plugin, with per-symbol
implementation status and notes — see [STATUS.md](STATUS.md).

Legend:


| Mark | Meaning                                                                                                      |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ✅    | Implemented and working on the listed models. "Tested" column says where the author has physically verified. |
| ⚠️   | Partial / soft-fails / needs a prerequisite (see Notes).                                                     |
| ❌    | Not implemented (see "What is not implemented" for scope rationale).                                         |


The **Impl** column distinguishes:

- **Native** — the plugin speaks the same wire protocol the stock
`bambu_networking.so` does. Drop-in behaviour.
- **Workaround** — the plugin reaches the same user-visible outcome
over a different transport. Listed individually in
[Workaround reference](#workaround-reference) below; all of them
can be compiled out together with `-DOBN_ENABLE_WORKAROUNDS=OFF`.
- **Passthrough** — the plugin just forwards MQTT / REST payloads;
Studio does the work.

### Basics (model-independent)


| Feature                              | Status | Impl                | Notes                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------ | ------ | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SSDP discovery (LAN)                 | ✅      | Native              | Multicast listener on `239.255.255.250:1990` + Studio `on_server_connected`_.                                                                                        |

| Cloud MQTT telemetry                 | ✅      | Native              | TLS to `us.mqtt.bambulab.com:8883`. Runs in parallel with LAN when signed in; not exercised during LAN-focused testing.                                              |
| Cloud login / ticket flow            | ✅      | Native              | Browser → `localhost` callback → `POST /user-service/user/ticket/<T>`. Session persisted to `obn.auth.json`.                                                         |
| User presets sync / profile / avatar | ✅      | Native + Workaround | List / create / update / delete over `POST                                                                                                                           |
| MQTT command signing                 | ❌      | —                   | Stock plugin carries per-install RSA keys we don't reproduce. Workaround for the user: enable Developer Mode on the printer (all LAN commands bypass signing there). |


### Printing


| Feature                                    | Status            | Impl        | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LAN print (FTPS + MQTT, Dev Mode)          | ✅ (tested on P2S) | Native      | `STOR /cache/<name>` then `{"print":{"command":"project_file",...}}` on LAN MQTT.                                                                                                                                |
| "Send to Printer" dialog (`ft_*`)          | ✅ (tested on P2S) | Workaround  | `ft_*` C ABI served over FTPS (`OBN_FT_FTPS_FASTPATH`, ON by default); stock uses a proprietary port-6000 tunnel. With `OFF` Studio falls back to its internal FTP path — same file, same place, less UI polish. |
| Cloud 3MF upload to S3                     | ✅                 | Native      | 6-step upload sequence reversed from MITM of the stock plugin.                                                                                                                                                   |
| `create_task` (MakerWorld entry)           | ⚠️                | ❌           | Soft-fails — logs 4xx, keeps going with `task_id="0"`. Printing works; MakerWorld history and timelapse-on-printer cloud flags don't. See [MakerWorld integration](#makerworld-integration).                     |
| "Print from Device" (`start_sdcard_print`) | ✅ (tested on P2S) | Workaround  | Stock plugin: cloud REST endpoint we can't sign. Ours: publish `project_file` on LAN MQTT for a file already on the printer.                                                                                     |
| AMS telemetry / mapping                    | ✅                 | Passthrough | Studio consumes `push_status` directly.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Nozzle mapping / multi-extruder            | ✅ (not tested)    | Passthrough | All MQTT passthrough — same code path as AMS. Applies only to dual-nozzle hardware (H2C, H2D, X2D). Author has no such printer to verify.                                                                        |


### Camera liveview

Camera protocol differs by model (see the hardware matrix). Both paths
share the same `libBambuSource.so` tunnel API towards Studio; the
difference is what happens inside.


| Feature                           | Applies to                        | Status            | Impl       | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| MJPEG over TLS, port 6000              | A1, A1 mini                       | ✅ (not tested)    | Native | Same TCP-over-TLS stream the stock plugin consumes. No A-series hardware for physical verification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| RTSPS → H.264 byte-stream, port 322    | P1S, X1 (all), P2S, H-series, X2D | ✅ (tested on P2S) | Native | Same wire format the stock plugin uses: raw H.264 Annex-B byte-stream out via `Bambu_ReadSample`; the slicer's vendored `gstbambusrc` decodes it. |
| Cloud camera (TUTK / Agora p2p)        | any printer out of LAN            | ❌                 | ❌      | Proprietary libraries; out of scope — use LAN/Developer Mode instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |


### File browser (Device → Files)

All four operations run in a worker thread inside `libBambuSource.so`,
serviced against FTPS (port 990) on the printer. Same transport for
every Bambu LAN firmware, so this row is identical across models
except for the storage-root layout (see hardware matrix).

| Current-print thumbnail cover               | All models | ✅ (tested on P2S) | Mixed       | Covers both runtime paths: **(a)** LAN-only prints where `project_id=profile_id=subtask_id="0"` — the plugin rewrites those to synthetic `"lan-<fnv>"` ids on every `push_status` (workaround, pushes Studio off its SD-card placeholder branch); **(b)** cloud-initiated subtasks whose real ids are still attached after unbinding — here the plugin answers `get_subtask_info(<real_id>)` instead of routing through Bambu's CDN (regular stock replacement). Both paths share the same backend: localhost HTTP server pulls `/cache/<subtask>.gcode.3mf` over FTPS, unpacks `Metadata/plate_N.png`, serves it as `thumbnail.url = http://127.0.0.1:<port>/cover/…`. Same image HA uses. **Linux only: requires `[patches/bambustudio-statuspanel-thumbnail.patch](patches/bambustudio-statuspanel-thumbnail.patch)` applied to Studio** — `wxStaticBitmap` under wxGTK doesn't fire `wxEVT_PAINT` on `Bind()`'d handlers, so `PrintingTaskPanel::paint()` never runs and neither the LAN cover nor stock cloud covers ever show. |
| Firmware version panel (Device → Update)    | All models | ✅ (tested on P2S) | Mixed       | `bambu_network_get_printer_firmware` re-synthesises the "firmware list" Studio expects from the MQTT frames the printer already sends (`info.module[]` replies + `push_status.upgrade_state.new_ver_list`). That populates the Update tab with current per-module versions (OTA, AMS, AHB, …), stock-style. When the printer advertises a newer version the "current → new" arrow and the green "update available" badge appear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Needed so Studio's Send-to-Printer UI doesn't grey out on a printer whose external storage is USB-only. H-series / X2D probably need this too, but no hardware available to confirm. |
| `push_status` `ipcam.file` block injection    | P2S, A-series, older X1/P1 firmware | ✅ (tested on P2S) | Workaround | Only triggers when the block is absent; firmware that already advertises it is passed through. Makes Studio open the file-browser tunnel in the first place.                                                                                                                                    |

| Windows / macOS | ❌              | Architected for but not built — ABI uses `std::string`/`std::map`/`std::function` across the `dlsym` boundary, which needs MSVC STL on Windows and Xcode libc++ on macOS. Plus Studio enforces code-signing publisher matches on those OSes. |


### Hardware reality (what each model actually does)

Use this to figure out which rows above apply to your printer. The
plugin doesn't hard-code any of this — it auto-detects storage layout
and camera transport at runtime and speaks the right protocol per
printer. The table exists only to tell you *which* cell of the tables
above applies.

¹ Specs for newer / not-yet-widely-available models are best-effort
from public product pages and Studio's built-in model enum; the
protocol parts (camera port, FTPS layout) are auto-detected at
runtime, so the plugin itself doesn't rely on the table being exact.
Corrections welcome from anyone with the actual hardware.

### Model specifics

Storage on the printer depends on the model: X1 / P1P / A1 (and A1
mini) use a microSD slot, while **P2S has a USB port instead** (no SD
slot). The plugin auto-detects which mount is available and uploads
to the right path:

- X1 / P1P / A1: FTPS exposes `/sdcard/` and (sometimes) `/usb/`; the
`ft_`* fast-path probes both with `CWD` and reports whatever answers.
- P2S: FTPS has **no** `/sdcard` or `/usb` subdirectory — the FTPS root
*is* the USB stick, so files sit right at `/`. The plugin detects
this (both probes fail, root is reachable) and still advertises
`"sdcard"` to Studio so the Send-to-Printer radio shows "External
Storage"; uploads go to `/<dest_name>` (no prefix).

There's one more P2S-specific twist: the printer reports `home_flag`
with `NO_SDCARD` bits because, strictly speaking, it has no SD slot.
Studio's DeviceManager parses those bits into `DevStorage::SdcardState`,
which turns the Send button grey and shows a red "Please check the
network …" tile in the Device/Storage panel. Since we *can* write to
the USB over FTPS, the plugin rewrites bits 8-9 of `home_flag` from
`NO_SDCARD` (00) to `HAS_SDCARD_NORMAL` (01) on every `push_status`
frame. Real error states (`ABNORMAL`=10, `READONLY`=11) and printers
that already report `HAS_SDCARD` are passed through unchanged.

`⚠️ soft-fail` means the step logs a warning and continues with `task_id="0"`.
Printing works; the job does not show up in the cloud's job history and the
timelapse/record-on-printer cloud flags have no effect. Local print records
on the printer itself still work.

## Workaround reference

Everything marked **Workaround** in the table above is a deliberate
non-stock path chosen to get a Developer-Mode printer usable without
the proprietary secrets the stock plugin carries. All of them are
gated behind one CMake flag, `-DOBN_ENABLE_WORKAROUNDS` (default
`ON`). Build with `=OFF` if you want a strict drop-in that only
exposes the native paths from the "What works" table above — Studio
will transparently lose the affected features (Send greys out on P2S,
file browser stays empty on Dev-Mode printers, "Print from Device"
errors out with "start_sdcard_print disabled", RTSPS liveview refuses
to open, etc.), but nothing half-done runs at runtime.

| Cross-device user preset sync                                  | Stock plugin's `get_setting_list2` only fetches metadata (`setting_id`, `name`, `update_time`, …) from `GET /v1/iot-service/api/slicer/setting`, assuming the matching preset body is already present on disk under `<config_dir>/user/<uid>/`. On a fresh machine the list walk produces a `setting_id` with no `setting` map to merge in, so `PresetCollection::load_user_preset()` silently skips every cloud preset and your profiles disappear. | For each preset the Studio-provided `CheckFn` flags as needed, we additionally issue `GET /v1/iot-service/api/slicer/setting/<setting_id>` to pull the full `setting` payload, then inject `user_id` (not returned by the server) and convert `update_time` from `"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"` into the unix-seconds string `load_user_preset()` expects. The resulting flat `values_map` is handed to Studio exactly where it would expect one from a local file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Studio's loader path and the cloud endpoint both exist; the stock plugin simply never connects the two.

| Firmware info synthesis (`get_printer_firmware`)               | Stock plugin serves `GET /v1/iot-service/api/slicer/resource/printer/firmware?dev_id=…` against the Bambu cloud, returning a JSON envelope (current/new version per module + release notes + binary URL) that Studio's `UpgradePanel` and `ReleaseNoteDialog` render.                                                                                                                                                                                | The plugin doesn't call the cloud at all. Instead the agent maintains a `DeviceFw` cache keyed by `dev_id` that harvests versions from every MQTT frame the printer already sends: `info.command=get_version` replies (module array with `name`/`sw_ver`/`sn`/`loader_ver`) and `push_status.upgrade_state.new_ver_list`. `render_firmware_json(dev_id)` then emits the same envelope Studio expects — current versions populate the Update panel, advertised newer versions light up the "update available" banner, the description links to `bambulab.com/en/support/firmware-download/all`. The actual flash is a passthrough: Studio's "Update" button publishes `{"upgrade":{"command":"upgrade_confirm"}}` on LAN MQTT, and the printer fetches the binary from Bambu's CDN itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | The cloud firmware catalogue requires a signed request with an `accessToken` for a linked account and answers with HTML behind Cloudflare from an untrusted client (no stable public JSON).

| Current-print thumbnail cover                                  | Stock plugin gets `project_id`/`profile_id`/`subtask_id` back from the cloud task it created, and `get_subtask_info` returns a `thumbnail.url` served out of Bambu's CDN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Two runtime paths share the same backend: **(a)** LAN-only prints whose ids come through as `"0"` — `MachineObject::is_sdcard_printing()` would otherwise route the Device-panel thumbnail to a static SD-card placeholder, so we rewrite the zeros to synthetic `"lan-<fnv>"` ids on every `push_status` (this part is the workaround). **(b)** Cloud-initiated subtasks that still carry their real numeric ids (e.g. after unbinding a cloud-paired printer) — Studio calls `get_subtask_info(<real_id>)` exactly like it would against stock; we just serve that ourselves instead of the CDN. Both paths land in the same backend: a single-thread HTTP server on `127.0.0.1:<random>`, FTPS-download of `/cache/<subtask>.gcode.3mf`, unpack `Metadata/plate_N.png` via zlib raw-inflate and serve as `image/png` behind the URL we return from `get_subtask_info`. On Linux this additionally requires `[patches/bambustudio-statuspanel-thumbnail.patch](patches/bambustudio-statuspanel-thumbnail.patch)` against Studio: `PrintingTaskPanel::set_thumbnail_img` relies on a custom `wxEVT_PAINT` handler which `wxStaticBitmap` doesn't dispatch under wxGTK (native `GtkImage` wrapper), so without the patch no cover — LAN or cloud — ever becomes visible on screen. | wxWebRequest on libsoup3 / Linux rejects `file://` URLs; a loopback HTTP server is the minimum that still uses the same code path cloud thumbnails take. File is cached under `temp_directory_path()/obn-covers/` so reprint requests don't re-download the archive. `/cache/` is the drop-zone for both `start_local_print_with_record` and the printer's own cloud-download, so one lookup covers both origins. | Extra 2-20 MB FTPS `RETR` once per print, a socket listener on loopback for the lifetime of the plugin, and a 15 s wait budget inside the HTTP server while the FTPS worker is still fetching. If the .3mf is gone from `/cache/` the server returns 503 → Studio falls back to its broken-image icon (clickable to retry).              |


The first four rows are gated by `OBN_ENABLE_WORKAROUNDS`; the last three — firmware info synthesis, cross-device preset sync, and the thumbnail cover — always run, because they either cannot cause runtime regressions vs. stock behaviour (there is no stock path at all under Developer Mode) or the stock behaviour they replace is silent data loss rather than a graceful degradation. The `ft_`* fastpath has its own flag because stock-compatible builds may want to keep Send-to-Printer's UI progress working while turning everything else off. The RTSPS camera path is **not** gated — it produces the same byte-stream stock does.

## Cloud sign-in

Even though every print path is local, the plugin still implements
Bambu's cloud account login. The reason is that Studio's UI and preset
machinery are heavily wired to a logged-in `user_id`: without a session
a number of features quietly degrade. With a session they behave as
they did under the stock plugin.

**What login gives you:**

After sign-in, Studio may show a **Synchronization** dialog asking
whether to pull personal data from Bambu Cloud. The stock UI lists
exactly three categories — the same ones the account machinery is built
around:

1. **Process presets** (print / process profiles)
2. **Filament presets**
3. **Printer presets** (machine profiles)

- **User presets sync.** On startup Studio calls
`preset_bundle->load_user_presets(agent->get_user_id(), ...)` and
scans `<config_dir>/user/<uid>/` for the three preset kinds above
(plus AMS material mappings and anything else tied to the account).
A background worker then pushes each dirty preset to the cloud under
`/v1/iot-service/api/slicer/setting` — `POST` for new presets,
`PATCH` for edits, `DELETE` for removals — and periodically lists
the server catalogue back via `get_setting_list2` to pull in changes
made on other devices. Without a session Studio falls back to
`DEFAULT_USER_FOLDER_NAME` and your custom profiles are invisible.
- **Avatar and nickname in the sidebar.** The "Sign in" button turns
into your profile widget.
- **Cloud device list / bind status.** Studio queries
`/v1/iot-service/api/user/bind` with your `accessToken` to show which
printers are paired with your account. Used for the device picker
and the "Bind to cloud" dialog; LAN discovery still works without it.
- **Filament CDN metadata.** Some OEM filament entries pull extra data
(colour swatches, recommended profiles) from authenticated cloud
endpoints. Missing these shows up as a generic filament name.

**What login does *not* give you:**

- It does **not** enable MQTT command signing — the printer still
refuses unsigned commands outside Developer Mode regardless of who
you are signed in as (see
[MQTT command signing](#mqtt-command-signing-err_code-84033543)).
- It does **not** register your prints on MakerWorld. `create_task`
soft-fails (see the table below).
- It does **not** unlock the TUTK/Agora cloud-p2p transports. Those
need a separate proprietary library.

**How the flow works:**

1. Studio opens the account portal in the system browser or its
  embedded wxWebView. The URL Studio uses is composed from
   `web_host(region)` (which the plugin reports) and a `callback`
   query string pointing at `http://localhost:<port>/`.
2. After the user authenticates, the portal redirects the browser to
  `http://localhost:<port>/?ticket=<T>&redirect_url=...`. Studio's
   in-process HTTP server picks up the ticket.
3. Studio calls into the plugin: `bambu_network_get_my_token(ticket)`
  runs `POST /v1/user-service/user/ticket/<T>`; we get back
   `{accessToken, refreshToken, expiresIn, ...}`.
4. Studio then calls `bambu_network_get_my_profile` → we run
  `GET /v1/user-service/my/profile` with `Authorization: Bearer …`.
5. Studio assembles `{"data":{"token":"…","refresh_token":"…",
  "expires_in":"…","user":{"uid":"…","name":"…", …}}}`and feeds it  back via`bambu_network_change_user`.` Agent::apply_login_info`
   accepts both that envelope and the raw API shape.
6. The session is persisted to `<config_dir>/obn.auth.json` with
  mode 0600. On next Studio start the plugin loads it and reports
   `is_user_login() == true` without prompting again. The plugin
   rotates the access token via
   `POST /v1/user-service/user/refreshtoken` as the expiry approaches.
7. Logout (Studio menu → "Log Out") calls `bambu_network_user_logout`,
  which clears `obn.auth.json` and the in-memory session.

**Running without sign-in** is fully supported: go straight to 
"Device → Connect via LAN with access code",
and LAN printing / camera / discovery / FTPS all work. You'll just
lose the Studio features in the second list above.

## What is **not** implemented

These are deliberate scope choices, not bugs. Each one is either out of
reach without cryptographic secrets we don't have, or hidden behind a
proprietary transport we haven't reversed:

### MQTT command signing (`err_code: 84033543`)

Newer firmware requires every MQTT command sent to the printer to carry a
per-installation RSA signature. The stock plugin ships the keys as
obfuscated data. Without those, the printer rejects commands with
"MQTT Command verification failed" on screen.
**Workaround:** put the printer in Developer Mode (above), which disables
verification.

### MakerWorld integration

`POST /v1/user-service/my/task` (create cloud task record) and the
related tracking endpoints all require the signing chain above plus
client-side certification headers (`x-bbl-app-certification-id`,
`x-bbl-device-security-sign`) that the stock plugin computes in native
code. We log the 40x and continue, so the print itself completes.
**Scope:** out of scope permanently — this is a closed network service.

### FileTransfer module (`ft_`* C ABI)

Used by Studio for the "Send to Printer" dialog (upload without
printing), the eMMC pre-flight check in the regular Print job, and a
handful of media-ability queries. The proprietary plugin serves these
over a port-6000 TLS tunnel with a JSON command framer we haven't
reimplemented. See
[NETWORK_PLUGIN.md § 6.14](NETWORK_PLUGIN.md#614-file-transfer-abi-ft_)
for the ABI contract and
[STATUS.md § 6.14](STATUS.md#614-file-transfer-abi-ft_) for the
per-symbol status of the two modes below.

We have two modes, toggled at configure time with
`-DOBN_FT_FTPS_FASTPATH=ON|OFF` (default **ON**):

`**OBN_FT_FTPS_FASTPATH=ON` (default).**
For `bambu:///local/`* URLs the plugin serves the ABI over the same
FTPS connection the print job uses:

- `cmd_type=7` (media ability) is answered by probing `CWD /sdcard`
and `CWD /usb` on the printer. X1/P1P/A1 and first-gen A1 mini have
the SD-card mount; P2S has a USB port instead. Printers with both
will get both back. If *neither* path answers but the FTPS login
itself succeeded (the P2S case), the fastpath treats the FTPS root
as the storage mount and reports `["sdcard"]` so Studio's picker
lights up. `emmc` is never reported — on Bambu firmware that storage
is for system files, not user uploads.
- `cmd_type=5` (upload) runs `STOR /<dest_storage>/<dest_name>` with
byte-level progress forwarded to Studio as `{"progress":N}` via
`msg_cb` (skipping 99, which Studio reserves as a timeout tripwire).
When the tunnel is in root-is-storage mode the `STOR` target is just
`/<dest_name>`.
- TUTK/Agora URLs still return `FT_EIO` — we don't speak the cloud
p2p transport.

Net effect: the "Send to Printer" dialog walks through the same UI
states as with the stock plugin (Reading storage → picker → sending
with real % progress), the eMMC pre-flight in the regular Print job
gets a clean `["sdcard"]` / `["usb"]` answer and Studio stops logging
a fallback every time.

`**OBN_FT_FTPS_FASTPATH=OFF`.**
Every `ft_`* entry point is a polite-failure stub that fires its
callback synchronously with `FT_EIO` and a "fall back to FTP" message.
Studio's internal fallback kicks in and the 3mf is uploaded through
`bambu_network_start_send_gcode_to_sdcard`, which also uses FTPS.
Same file lands in the same place — the UI just skips the media-
ability step and the per-percent progress comes from the fallback
instead.

**Scope:** the fastpath is a deliberate shortcut, not a clean
reimplementation of the proprietary port-6000 protocol. If you need
MakerWorld-style project metadata, eMMC-as-primary-storage, or the
"Send to multiple machines" batch UI to work end-to-end, you'll still
be limited to what the fallback path supports.

### PrinterFileSystem (SD/USB browser UI in Studio)

Studio's MediaFilePanel opens a port-6000 tunnel through `libBambuSource.so`
and then switches it to a CTRL channel via `Bambu_StartStreamEx(CTRL_TYPE)`.
From there it sends JSON request/response messages (`LIST_INFO`, `SUB_FILE`,
`FILE_DOWNLOAD`, `FILE_DEL`, `REQUEST_MEDIA_ABILITY`, `TASK_CANCEL`) that
Studio renders as the Device → Files panel (timelapses, camera recordings,
printed models with thumbnails).

`libBambuSource.so` does **not** speak the proprietary CTRL wire protocol;
instead it runs a worker thread per tunnel that services those JSON requests
over **FTPS** (the same service we use for "Print via LAN" uploads). That
gives Studio the full file browser on every printer we can reach over TLS
on port 990, regardless of whether the firmware implements the CTRL protocol
itself.

Supported operations:

- `REQUEST_MEDIA_ABILITY` — probe `/sdcard` and `/usb`; if neither exists we
treat the FTPS root as the storage mount (P2S-style USB-only) and report
it as `"sdcard"` to Studio.
- `LIST_INFO` — `LIST` (Bambu firmware does not implement `MLSD`) on:
`<prefix>/timelapse/` for the timelapse tab,
`<prefix>/ipcam/` for the manual video tab,
`<prefix>/` for the model tab.
Files are filtered by extension (`.mp4`, `.3mf`, `.gcode.3mf`).
- `SUB_FILE` thumbnails — for timelapses we fetch the sidecar `.jpg`; for
`.3mf` files we download the archive, parse the central directory, and
`inflate` `Metadata/plate_1.png` (or `plate_no_light_1.png`) using zlib's
raw deflate — no external ZIP dependency.
- `FILE_DOWNLOAD` — streaming `RETR` with 256 KB chunks, each chunk
delivered as a separate `CONTINUE` reply so Studio's progress bar
updates smoothly. The final reply is `SUCCESS`.
- `FILE_DEL` — `DELE` per path (modern form `{"paths":[…]}` only; the
legacy `{"delete":[…]}` form isn't used by current Studio releases).
- `TASK_CANCEL` — marks a sequence number; the worker aborts the relevant
multi-chunk response cleanly at the next check point.

`FILE_UPLOAD` is intentionally not implemented here: Studio's
"Send to Printer" dialog uses the separate `ft_`* ABI (see above), which
already has an FTPS fastpath.

For printers whose firmware **does** send `ipcam.file` in its MQTT
`push_status` (X1 / P1S class), the plugin passes it through untouched —
those printers speak the real CTRL protocol to their stock BambuSource,
and we don't want to clobber a capability we don't match exactly.

For printers that **don't** advertise `ipcam.file` (P2S, A-series, some
firmware revisions) the plugin injects
`"file":{"local":"local","remote":"none","model_download":"enabled"}`
into every LAN `ipcam` block. That's what makes Studio open the
port-6000 tunnel in the first place; without it, MediaFilePanel would
short-circuit with "Browsing file in storage is not supported in current
firmware." and never give us a CTRL channel to service.

**Storage root layout:**


| Printer | FTPS layout                                 | Our prefix  |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| X1 / P1 | `/sdcard/{,timelapse,ipcam,…}`              | `/sdcard`   |
| A1      | `/sdcard/…` (microSD)                       | `/sdcard`   |
| P2S     | `/timelapse`, `/ipcam`, `/*.gcode.3mf` on / | `""` (root) |


The P2S variant uses the "FTPS root == USB stick" convention from our
`ft_`* implementation. We re-advertise it as `"sdcard"` because Studio's
storage dropdown treats anything that isn't `"emmc"` as removable media.

**Limitations:** Studio still refuses to *open* the browser in LAN Only
Mode for X1/P1S/P2S ("Browsing file in storage is not supported in LAN
Only Mode") — that check lives inside Studio itself, ahead of the
plugin. Developer Mode (which is what we target anyway) bypasses it.

### TUTK / Agora cloud p2p transports

Used by Studio as a fallback when LAN is unavailable and for the X1 family
in non-LAN mode. Closed-source proprietary libraries (`libBambuTUTK` /
`libBambuAgora`) implement them. We don't wrap either.
**Scope:** out of scope — use LAN/Developer Mode instead.

## Build and install

### Dependencies (Linux)

You need **CMake ≥ 3.20**, a **C++17** compiler, **pkg-config**, and development
headers for everything the project links against:


| Component                           | Debian / Ubuntu packages                                                                             | Fedora-style packages                                                             |

| Toolchain                           | `build-essential`, `cmake`, `pkg-config`                                                             | `gcc-c++`, `cmake`, `pkgconf-pkg-config`                                          |
| MQTT / JSON / HTTP / TLS / zlib     | `libmosquitto-dev`, `libcjson-dev`, `uthash-dev`, `libcurl4-openssl-dev`, `libssl-dev`, `zlib1g-dev` | `mosquitto-devel`, `uthash-devel`, `libcurl-devel`, `openssl-devel`, `zlib-devel` |

One-shot install examples:

```sh
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install build-essential cmake pkg-config \
  libmosquitto-dev libcjson-dev uthash-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev zlib1g-dev
```

```sh
# Fedora
sudo dnf install gcc-c++ cmake pkgconf-pkg-config \
  mosquitto-devel cjson-devel uthash-devel libcurl-devel openssl-devel zlib-devel
```

### Configure, build, install

From the repository root, the usual three commands:

```sh
./configure
make
make install
```

No `sudo` needed — the default install prefix is inside your home directory.

> **Important!**  
> If Studio runs in an **isolated environment** where `**libmosquitto` is not
> available or not visible** at runtime (**Flatpak**, **Docker**/**OCI** images, minimal
> sandboxes), add `**--vendor-mosquitto`** to `./configure` (see the `[./configure` options](#configure-options) table below).

That's it. `./configure` is a thin wrapper around CMake that writes the build
tree into `build/` and picks sensible defaults for a typical Linux user:
install prefix `~/.config/BambuStudio` (the same directory Bambu Studio uses),
release build. `make install` then:

1. copies the four shared objects + manifest into that directory:
  - `~/.config/BambuStudio/plugins/libbambu_networking.so`
  - `~/.config/BambuStudio/plugins/libBambuSource.so` (stub)
  - `~/.config/BambuStudio/plugins/liblive555.so` (stub)
  - `~/.config/BambuStudio/ota/plugins/network_plugins.json`
2. edits `~/.config/BambuStudio/BambuStudio.conf` so Studio trusts this
  plugin and stops trying to re-download its own on every launch — sets
   `"installed_networking": "1"` and `"update_network_plugin": "false"`
   under the `"app"` object, with a `.obn-bak` backup next to the
   original. This step is skipped when the install prefix is not the
   default BambuStudio dir (staging trees stay clean), or you can turn
   it off explicitly with `./configure --no-conf-patch`.

`make uninstall` walks the install manifest and removes whatever was put
down; `make clean` / `make distclean` drop build artefacts; `make test`
runs the smoke tests via `ctest`.

### `./configure` options

`./configure --help` prints the full list; the most useful ones:


| Flag                      | Default                                        | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

When the resolved prefix is the slicer's Flatpak config dir (either auto-detected or passed via `--prefix=`), `--vendor-mosquitto` is enabled by default (override with `--no-vendor-mosquitto`).

| `--with-version=VER`      | auto-detected from the slicer's conf           | The version string `bambu_network_get_version()` reports. The slicer compares only the **first 8 characters** (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`), so e.g. AppImage `v02.05.02.51` wants `02.05.02.`* and a main-branch source build usually wants `02.05.03.*`. When `--with-version` is not given, `./configure` auto-detects: for Studio it reads `app.version` from `<prefix>/BambuStudio.conf`; for Orca it reads `app.network_plugin_version` from `<prefix>/OrcaSlicer.conf` (falling back to `02.03.00` if absent). Either way it bumps the last component to `99` so our plugin always looks "newer" than the agent the slicer ships with itself. Maps to `-DOBN_VERSION=…`.                                       |

`./configure --help` also lists less common flags (including Mosquitto linking
options). Driving **CMake** directly works the same way; see `OBN_`* and
other cache variables in `CMakeLists.txt`.

### First-time Studio configuration

`make install` edits `~/.config/BambuStudio/BambuStudio.conf` for you on the
first run (see the list above). If you skipped that step — or if Studio has
never been launched on this machine so the file does not exist yet — add
these two keys to the `"app"` object by hand:

```json
"installed_networking": "1",
"update_network_plugin": "false"
```

### Installing for Orca Slicer

Orca Slicer loads the same plugin ABI as Bambu Studio, so this project
also drops in cleanly under it — pass `--client-type=orca_slicer` to
`./configure` and the rest stays the same:

```sh
./configure --client-type=orca_slicer
make
make install
```

`./configure --client-type=orca_slicer` picks Orca-specific defaults:

- **Install prefix.** Native preferred: picks `~/.config/OrcaSlicer` if
  it exists; otherwise falls back to the Flatpak config dir
  `~/.var/app/com.orcaslicer.OrcaSlicer/config/OrcaSlicer/` if THAT
  exists; otherwise stays with `~/.config/OrcaSlicer` anyway. Override
  with an explicit `--prefix=DIR` (e.g. when both installs are present
  and you want to target the Flatpak one).
- **`--vendor-mosquitto` for Flatpak.** Same as for Studio — when the
  resolved prefix is a Flatpak config dir, `./configure` enables
  `--vendor-mosquitto` automatically. See [Flatpak problems](#flatpak-problems).
- **Plugin version.** Auto-detects `app.network_plugin_version` from
  `<prefix>/OrcaSlicer.conf` (Orca tracks the plugin version separately
  from the slicer version). If the key is absent — typically a brand-new
  Orca install — falls back to `02.03.00` and bumps the last component
  to `99`. Override with `--with-version=…`.
- **`.so` file name.** Orca dlopens
  `libbambu_networking_<network_plugin_version>.so` (the version is
  part of the file name). `make install` therefore renames our build
  artefact at install time, e.g. `libbambu_networking_02.03.00.99.so`,
  rather than the fixed `libbambu_networking.so` Studio expects.
  `libBambuSource.so` and `liblive555.so` keep their stock names —
  both slicers dlopen them by fixed name.
- **No `network_plugins.json`.** Orca does not use this file as a
  persistent OTA manifest the way Studio does — its
  `PresetUpdater` writes it as a transient artefact during an explicit
  user-triggered update flow and then deletes it. Shipping it would
  just accumulate stale state in the user's data dir, so the install
  step skips it for `--client-type=orca_slicer`.
- **Conf-file patch.** Instead of `BambuStudio.conf`'s two-key flip,
  `make install` patches **`OrcaSlicer.conf`** with four keys under
  `"app"`:
  - `"installed_networking": "true"`
  - `"network_plugin_version": "<OBN_VERSION>"`
  - `"network_plugin_remind_later": "true"` (suppresses Orca's
    "a newer plugin is available" prompt for this version)
  - removes `<OBN_VERSION>` from `"network_plugin_skipped_versions"`
    if it had been added previously.

  As with Studio, the patch only runs when the install prefix is the
  Orca config dir (native or Flatpak); a backup is written to
  `OrcaSlicer.conf.obn-bak`. Disable with `./configure --no-conf-patch`.

If you skipped the patch — or if Orca has never been launched so the
file does not exist yet — set those four keys (in JSON-string form, as
above) under `"app"` in `OrcaSlicer.conf` by hand.

For a Flatpak install where the native dir also exists (so the native
one wins by default), point `--prefix` at the Flatpak path explicitly
— see [Flatpak problems](#flatpak-problems).

### Flatpak problems

Both supported slicers ship as Flathub apps (`com.bambulab.BambuStudio`
and `com.orcaslicer.OrcaSlicer`). That layout is workable for this
plugin, but the Flatpak **sandbox and runtime** introduce pitfalls
the native `make install` path does not have.

**Install prefix.** The slicer loads plugins from `<data_dir>/plugins/`
(see [NETWORK_PLUGIN.md](NETWORK_PLUGIN.md)). Under Flatpak,
`data_dir` is usually under `~/.var/app/<ApplicationId>/config/`,
not `~/.config/<dir>/`. `./configure` handles this for you: when the
native config dir is missing, it auto-detects the Flatpak path for the
selected `--client-type` (and logs `configure: detected Flatpak ...
install at ...`). When you have BOTH installed and want the Flatpak
one, point `--prefix=` at it explicitly — same Flatpak id to expand
yourself if it differs from the upstream one (`flatpak list --app`):

```sh
# Bambu Studio Flatpak (default --client-type)
./configure \
  --prefix="$HOME/.var/app/com.bambulab.BambuStudio/config/BambuStudio"
make && make install

# Orca Slicer Flatpak
./configure --client-type=orca_slicer \
  --prefix="$HOME/.var/app/com.orcaslicer.OrcaSlicer/config/OrcaSlicer"
make && make install
```

**`libmosquitto` from the sandbox.** Flatpak's runtime usually does
not expose `libmosquitto.so` to the plugin, so the host's
`libmosquitto.so` cannot be `dlopen`'d from inside the sandbox.
`./configure` defaults `--vendor-mosquitto` to ON whenever the
resolved prefix is the slicer's Flatpak config dir (auto-detected or
passed explicitly). Override with `--no-vendor-mosquitto` if your
runtime does expose `libmosquitto`.

**Camera live view.** The plugin hands raw H.264 byte-stream out via
`Bambu_ReadSample`; the slicer's `gstbambusrc` then decodes it. The
Flatpak runtime has to provide the GStreamer H.264 decoders — on
Debian/Ubuntu hosts `gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad` plus either
`gstreamer1.0-libav` or `openh264` are enough; both slicers' Flatpak
manifests bundle these.

**Recommendation.** For the fewest surprises, run a **native** Studio package
from your distribution or an **official AppImage**, or **build Studio from
source** yourself so the plugin, wxWidgets, and multimedia stack all target the
same environment.

**AppImage compared to Flatpak.** They are not the same problem set.
An AppImage typically carries the slicer's dependencies next to the
binary and still uses the normal user `~/.config/BambuStudio` /
`~/.config/OrcaSlicer` data directory on Linux, so the default
`./configure` prefix is correct without Flatpak's `~/.var/app/…`
rewiring. You may still need `--vendor-mosquitto` if the AppImage's
namespace does not expose a usable `libmosquitto` to the plugin
(`./configure` will not flip it on for you in the AppImage case —
add it explicitly if needed). When in doubt about the rest of the
toolchain, prefer matching the slicer's release environment (same
distro packages or same upstream build instructions) or building both
the slicer and the plugin from source.

## Logging

The plugin writes a printf-style log of ABI calls and MQTT / FTPS /
HTTP activity. **Defaults:** severity **info**, output **only to stderr**
(the terminal that launched Bambu Studio). No log file is opened unless
you opt in — this keeps disk noise down for everyday use.

**Where it goes.**

- **Default:** stderr only (`OBN_LOG_STDERR=1`), each line prefixed with
`[obn]`  so it is easy to grep apart from Bambu Studio’s own stderr.
- **File next to Studio’s data directory:** set `OBN_LOG_TO_FILE=1` to
append to `<data_dir>/obn.log`, where `data_dir` is the path Studio
passes to `bambu_network_create_agent` (typically
`~/.config/BambuStudio/obn.log` on Linux).
- **Explicit path:** set `OBN_LOG_FILE` to an absolute path. Use
`/dev/null` to disable the file sink while keeping stderr. An empty
`OBN_LOG_FILE=` means “no file from env” (stderr only unless
`OBN_LOG_TO_FILE=1`).

**Log levels.** `trace < debug < info < warn < error < off`. The default
is **info**. Use `debug` or `trace` when diagnosing issues (`trace` adds
per-MQTT-frame and per-FTPS-command noise).

**Configuration via environment variables** (read once, on first log
call — export them *before* launching Studio):


| Variable          | Default   | Effect                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OBN_LOG_LEVEL`   | `info`    | Threshold: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `off`.                                                                                 |
| `OBN_LOG_STDERR`  | `1`       | When `1`, copy every line to stderr with an `[obn]` prefix. Set to `0` to suppress the console copy (only useful together with a file sink). |
| `OBN_LOG_TO_FILE` | *(unset)* | Set to `1`/`true`/`yes` to append to `<data_dir>/obn.log` after Studio passes `data_dir`. Ignored if `OBN_LOG_FILE` is set.                  |
| `OBN_LOG_FILE`    | *(unset)* | Absolute path to a log file. Creates the file sink when non-empty.                                                                           |


Example — default behaviour (info to terminal only):

```sh
bambu-studio
```

Example — persistent file next to Studio data, no stderr spam:

```sh
OBN_LOG_TO_FILE=1 OBN_LOG_LEVEL=info OBN_LOG_STDERR=0 bambu-studio
```

Example — full wire-level trace to a dedicated file:

```sh
OBN_LOG_LEVEL=trace OBN_LOG_FILE=/tmp/obn-session.log bambu-studio
```

**Line format:**

On stderr, each line starts with `[obn]` , then:

```
YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS.uuuuuu [LVL] [tid] file.cpp:line func_name: message
```

The file sink (if any) omits the `[obn]`  prefix — the file is plugin-only.

where `tid` is the OS thread id — useful to correlate MQTT
background-thread activity with Studio main-thread ABI calls.

**Secrets — be careful before sharing a log.** The plugin does *not*
currently auto-redact secrets. At `debug` and `trace` levels the log
can contain: printer access codes (MQTT password), session bearer /
refresh tokens from `obn.auth.json`, raw MQTT `push_status` payloads
(which include serial numbers and filament metadata), FTPS file
paths, and device IPs. Before pasting a log into a bug report, grep
out `access_code`, `Bearer`, `accessToken`, `refreshToken`,
`password`, and your printer's serial / WAN IP. (Tightening this up
into a proper redacting logger is on the TODO list.)

### `libBambuSource.so` logging

`libBambuSource.so` is `dlopen`'d separately from the main plugin and
runs inside the camera / file-browser code path that the slicer's media
widget drives. It keeps its own log mirror so you can see RTSP / TLS
failures even when the parent slicer process funnels its log somewhere
unhelpful.

| `OBN_BAMBUSOURCE_LOG_FILE`   | first writable of `$XDG_STATE_HOME/bambu-studio/obn-bambusource.log`, `$HOME/.local/state/bambu-studio/obn-bambusource.log`, `/tmp/obn-bambusource.log`                                          | Absolute path to the file mirror, or `off` / `none` / empty / `0` to disable, or `stderr` / `-` to route to stderr instead of a file.                                 |

The mirror file rolls every line through `[level]` plus a timestamp.
Lines are tagged with `rtsp:` (handshake / DESCRIBE / SETUP / PLAY) and
`rtsp_passthrough:` (the worker that hands the byte stream to
gstbambusrc). If you see no video despite a successful `rtsp: PLAY ok`
the issue is slicer-side (missing GStreamer H.264 decoder, e.g.
`gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad` / `gstreamer1.0-libav`).
